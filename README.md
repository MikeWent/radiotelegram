| Jack             | Contact Points |
|------------------|----------------|
| 3.5mm Baofeng    | Sleeve, Ring   |
| 2.5mm Baofeng    | Sleeve, Tip    |
| 3.5mm Microphone | Sleeve, Tip    |

1. find a datasheet for your ethernet transformer
2. select two pairs as shown on the schematics
3. cut cables, solder wires, that's it
4. polarity is not that crucial, for voice it's ok both ways.


## software

### config
1. copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. edit file: fill bot token, group id and topic id (if present).

### python3.13, ffmpeg, ffplay
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg python3.13-venv
```

`pyaudioop` was disconutinued in python3.13 so audioop-lts package is used.

    python3 -m venv ./venv
    source ./venv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    python3 ./radiotelegram/main.py
